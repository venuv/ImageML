# ImageML
* Starter code for anyone to play with pre-trained models (currently Resnet) that classify properties of the images they see. 
* Supports camera or photo library as source (see 'picker source' in CaptureImageVie)
* Code in Coordinator allows you to swap out pre-trained models for new ones
* State and Bindings are setup to display the results of an ML model prediction in the coordinator, on to the Content View. 
However, the logic of extracting the predication in Coordinator might need customizing
